<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Nice to meet you, </h1>
	<p>I'm a plant biologist/ecophysiologist.
	My research interests are pointed in direction of understanding how plants perceive and integrate the environmental cues 
		into systemic wide responses which helps them to adapt to various environmental conditions. 
		To tackle these questions I use geneticaly encoded fluorescent reporters to track cellular calcium & ROS dynamics.
