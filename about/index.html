    I am an ecophysiologist passionate about plant–environment interactions—both at home and professionally. In my work, I explore the complex physiological processes within plants and investigate the mechanisms by which they interact with their surroundings. Through my research, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how plants adapt and thrive under various environmental conditions while contributing to the development of more sustainable agricultural practices.

    My work in plant ecophysiology represents a crucial area of research with the potential to unlock new insights into how we can better understand and protect our natural ecosystems. To achieve this, I approach my work from multiple perspectives: beginning at the cell–cell communication level, I study how different environmental stimuli are perceived and how these individual signals are integrated into local or systemic plant responses. Expanding this knowledge further, I am investigating whether these local or systemic responses translate to a physiological level and ultimately whether there are phenotypic implications.

    To address these questions, I use various approaches—from kinetic phenotyping with genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (biosensors) to track cellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics, to image-based analyses and evaluation of phenotypic changes at the organ level. This involves spending many hours in the microscopy room, imaging and analyzing the intricate dynamics of interactions in plant biology.

    Lastly, I am also passionate about biostatistics—so if you need help analyzing your data, feel free to ask.
