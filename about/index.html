<div class="blurb">
	<p>As a plant ecophysiologist, my work involves exploring the complex physiological processes that occur within plants, and investigating the mechanisms by which they interact with their surroundings. 
		Through my research, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how plants are able to adapt and thrive in various environmental conditions, and to contribute to the development of more sustainable agricultural practices.
		Overall, my work as a plant ecophysiologist represents a crucial area of research, as it has the potential to unlock new insights into how we can better understand and protect our natural ecosystems.
		To tackle these questions I use geneticaly encoded fluorescent reporters to track cellular calcium & ROS dynamics. 
		Also, I am passionate about the biostatistics :) If you need help analyzing your data, feel free to ask :)
