<div class="blurb">
	<p>I am an ecophysiologist passionate about plant–environment interactions—both at home and professionally. I’m fascinated by all things plant-related.

In my work, I explore the complex physiological processes within plants and investigate the mechanisms by which they interact with their surroundings. Through my research, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how plants adapt and thrive under various environmental conditions while contributing to developing more sustainable agricultural practices. My work in plant ecophysiology represents a crucial area of research with the potential to unlock new insights into how we can better understand and protect our natural ecosystems. To address these questions, I utilize genetically encoded fluorescent reporters (GEFI, biosensors) to track cellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics. This involves spending many hours in the microscopy room, imaging and analyzing the intricate dynamics of interactions in plant biology. I am also passionate about biostatistics—if you need help analyzing your data, feel free to ask.
